- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gianmarco Bencivenni ( @CLOCKWORK95 )

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many subjects, mainly on scientific fields, but as a good nerd i really enjoy every creative stuff.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m studying to get the Master's Degree in Computer Engeneering while working as a software engineer consultant.
I am currently learning advanced computer engeneering subjects at University of Rome Tor Vergata, so i am often busy on new projects and stuff.
Current main concerns are: 
Software Engineering, CI/CD and DevOps, Machine Learning, Satellite Remote Sensing and Image Processing, Performance modeling of Computer Systems, Probability and Statistics, Advanced operating Systems and more. 
If you want to see my stuff you have a look at my repos!
