- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gianmarco Bencivenni ( @CLOCKWORK95 )

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many subjects, mainly on scientific fields, but as a good nerd i really enjoy every creative stuff.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m studying to get the Master's Degree in Computer Engeneering.
I am currently learning advanced computer engeneering subjects, at University of Rome Tor Vergata, so i am often busy on projects.
Current main concerns are: 
Machine Learning, Satellite Remote Sensing and Image Processing, Performance modeling of Computer Systems, Probability and Statistics. 
If you want to see my stuff you can just look at my repos!
